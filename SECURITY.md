## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose them.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of these channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred):
   - Go to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/yourusername/gaudi3-scale-starter/security/advisories) page
   - Click "New draft security advisory"
   - Fill in the details of the vulnerability

2. **Email**:
   - Send an email to: security@gaudi3-scale.org
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

3. **GPG Encrypted Email**:
   - Use our public key: [security-pgp-key.txt](security-pgp-key.txt)
   - Send to: security@gaudi3-scale.org

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Proposed Fix**: If you have suggestions for a fix
- **Credit**: How you'd like to be credited (optional)

### Response Timeline

We commit to the following response timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours of receiving the report
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours we'll provide an initial assessment
- **Fix Development**: Timeline depends on complexity (typically 1-2 weeks)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available and deployed

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Coordination**: We'll work with you to understand and validate the issue
2. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
3. **Security Advisory**: We'll publish a security advisory
4. **CVE Assignment**: We'll request a CVE if applicable
5. **Public Disclosure**: Full details disclosed after fix is available

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

**Installation Security**:
- Always install from official sources (PyPI, GitHub releases)
- Verify package signatures when available
- Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies
- Regularly update to the latest versions

**Configuration Security**:
- Never commit secrets or credentials to version control
- Use environment variables or secure secret management
- Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper access controls and authentication

**Infrastructure Security**:
- Follow cloud provider security best practices
- Use VPC/VNet isolation for training clusters
- Enable audit logging and monitoring
- Implement network security groups/firewalls

### For Developers

**Code Security**:
- Run security linters (bandit, safety) before committing
- Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Use type hints and validate inputs
- Follow secure coding practices

**CI/CD Security**:
- Use pinned action versions in GitHub workflows
- Store secrets securely using GitHub Secrets
- Enable branch protection rules
- Require code reviews for all changes

## Security Architecture

### Threat Model

We consider the following threat vectors:

1. **Supply Chain Attacks**:
   - Malicious dependencies
   - Compromised build processes
   - Tampered packages

2. **Infrastructure Attacks**:
   - Cloud account compromise
   - Network intrusions
   - Privilege escalation

3. **Data Security**:
   - Training data exposure
   - Model parameter theft
   - Inference attacks

4. **Application Security**:
   - Code injection
   - Deserialization attacks
   - Authentication bypass

### Security Controls

**Preventive Controls**:
- Dependency scanning with Safety and Snyk
- Secret scanning with GitGuardian and detect-secrets
- Static analysis with Bandit and CodeQL
- Infrastructure as Code security scanning

**Detective Controls**:
- Continuous monitoring and alerting
- Audit logging for all operations
- Security information and event management (SIEM)
- Regular security assessments

**Response Controls**:
- Incident response procedures
- Automated security patching
- Backup and recovery processes
- Communication protocols

## Security Dependencies

### Security Tools Used

- **GitGuardian**: Secret detection and monitoring
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanner
- **detect-secrets**: Baseline secret scanning
- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability management
- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis

### Security Integrations

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated security checks
- **GitHub Actions**: Continuous security scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **Security Advisories**: Vulnerability notifications

## Compliance and Standards

### Standards Compliance

We strive to comply with:
