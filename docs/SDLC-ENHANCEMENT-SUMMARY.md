- `docs/security/vulnerability-management.md` - Comprehensive vulnerability lifecycle management

**Security Enhancements:**
- SLSA provenance and attestation workflows
- Automated vulnerability scanning and remediation
- Supply chain security best practices
- Compliance monitoring and reporting

### 4. Operational Excellence 📊

**Added production-ready operations:**
- `docs/operations/disaster-recovery.md` - Multi-region DR strategy with automated failover
- `docs/operations/performance-optimization.md` - Comprehensive performance tuning for Gaudi3 HPUs

**Operational Features:**
- Multi-region disaster recovery (1-hour RTO, 15-minute RPO)
- Advanced HPU performance optimization
- Automated performance monitoring and alerting
- Infrastructure-as-Code disaster recovery

## Installation and Setup Instructions

### 1. GitHub Actions Setup (Manual - I cannot create workflows directly)

Since I cannot create GitHub Actions workflows directly, you'll need to manually create the workflow files:

```bash
# Create workflows directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy workflow templates
cp docs/workflows/comprehensive-ci.yml .github/workflows/ci.yml
cp docs/workflows/release-automation.yml .github/workflows/release.yml

# Set up required secrets in GitHub
# - GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY: For secret scanning
# - CODECOV_TOKEN: For coverage reporting
# - PYPI_API_TOKEN: For package publishing
```

### 2. Testing Configuration Activation

```bash
# Install additional testing dependencies
pip install pytest-benchmark pytest-mock pytest-asyncio

# Run tests with new configuration
pytest --cov=gaudi3_scale --benchmark-skip
```

### 3. Security Scanning Integration

```bash
# Install security tools
pip install safety bandit detect-secrets

# Run security baseline
detect-secrets scan --baseline .secrets.baseline

# Initial security scan
make security
```

### 4. Monitoring Setup

```bash
# Start monitoring stack
make monitor-up

# Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000
# Import performance dashboard from docs/operations/
```
