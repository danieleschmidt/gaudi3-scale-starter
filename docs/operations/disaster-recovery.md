# Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive disaster recovery (DR) strategy for Gaudi3 Scale infrastructure and services, ensuring business continuity and data protection in the event of system failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events.

## Recovery Objectives

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- **Critical Services**: 1 hour
- **Standard Services**: 4 hours  
- **Development Environment**: 24 hours
- **Complete Infrastructure**: 48 hours

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- **Production Data**: 15 minutes (continuous replication)
- **Configuration Data**: 1 hour (automated backups)
- **Development Data**: 24 hours (scheduled backups)
- **Documentation**: 1 week (version control)

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Region Deployment
```
Primary Region (us-east-1)
├── Production Cluster (8x Gaudi3 nodes)
├── Database (RDS with read replicas)
├── Object Storage (S3 with cross-region replication)
└── Monitoring Stack (Prometheus/Grafana)

Secondary Region (us-west-2)
├── Standby Cluster (4x Gaudi3 nodes - auto-scaling)
├── Database Replica (RDS cross-region replica)
├── Object Storage (S3 replica)
└── Monitoring Stack (backup instance)

Tertiary Region (eu-west-1)
├── Cold Standby (Infrastructure as Code ready)
├── Data Backup (S3 Glacier for long-term storage)
└── DR Testing Environment
```

## Backup Strategy

### Data Classification and Backup Frequency

#### Tier 1 - Critical Data (15 min RPO)
- **Training datasets**: Continuous sync to S3 with versioning
- **Model checkpoints**: Real-time replication to multiple regions
- **Configuration data**: Git-backed with automated commits
- **Secrets and keys**: Encrypted backup every 5 minutes

#### Tier 2 - Important Data (1 hour RPO)
- **Monitoring data**: Hourly snapshots with 30-day retention
- **Log files**: Centralized logging with 1-hour backup window
- **User preferences**: Database backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Performance metrics**: Aggregated data with hourly backups

#### Tier 3 - Standard Data (24 hour RPO)
- **Development environments**: Daily snapshots
- **Test data**: Weekly backups with monthly retention
- **Documentation**: Version-controlled with daily Git pushes
- **Temporary files**: Excluded from backups (recreated on demand)

### Backup Verification and Testing

#### Automated Backup Validation
```yaml
# .github/workflows/backup-validation.yml
name: Backup Validation
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM

jobs:
  validate-backups:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Test S3 Backup Integrity
        run: |
          aws s3 cp s3://gaudi3-backups/latest-backup.tar.gz /tmp/
          tar -tzf /tmp/latest-backup.tar.gz
          
      - name: Test Database Backup
        run: |
          pg_restore --list backup.sql | wc -l
          
      - name: Validate Model Checkpoints
        run: |
          python scripts/validate_checkpoints.py --backup-path s3://gaudi3-models/
```

## Disaster Scenarios and Response

### Scenario 1: Single Node Failure
**Impact**: Reduced training capacity, potential job failures
**Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts within 2 minutes
**Response**:
1. **Immediate (0-5 min)**: Auto-scaling triggers replacement node
2. **Short-term (5-15 min)**: Redistribute running jobs to healthy nodes
3. **Medium-term (15-60 min)**: Investigate root cause, apply fixes
4. **Long-term**: Update infrastructure to prevent recurrence

### Scenario 2: Regional Outage
**Impact**: Complete service unavailability in primary region
**Detection**: Multi-region monitoring detects within 5 minutes
**Response**:
1. **Immediate (0-15 min)**: Activate secondary region via automated failover
2. **Short-term (15-60 min)**: Redirect traffic using DNS updates
3. **Medium-term (1-4 hours)**: Scale up secondary region to full capacity
4. **Long-term**: Maintain secondary region until primary restored

### Scenario 3: Data Corruption
**Impact**: Loss of training data or model corruption
**Detection**: Data integrity checks during scheduled validation
**Response**:
1. **Immediate**: Stop all processes using corrupted data
2. **Assessment**: Determine extent of corruption and affected systems
3. **Recovery**: Restore from most recent clean backup
4. **Validation**: Verify data integrity before resuming operations

### Scenario 4: Security Breach
**Impact**: Potential data exfiltration, system compromise
**Detection**: Security monitoring and intrusion detection systems
**Response**:
1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems, preserve forensic evidence
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope of breach and data exposure
3. **Recovery**: Restore from clean backups, apply security patches
4. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders per incident response plan

## Recovery Procedures

### Automated Failover Process
```python
# scripts/disaster_recovery.py
class DisasterRecovery:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.primary_region = config['primary_region']
        self.secondary_region = config['secondary_region']
        self.failover_threshold = config['failover_threshold']
        
    def check_primary_health(self):
        """Monitor primary region health metrics."""
        metrics = self.get_health_metrics(self.primary_region)
        if metrics['availability'] < self.failover_threshold:
            self.initiate_failover()
            
    def initiate_failover(self):
        """Execute automated failover to secondary region."""
        steps = [
            self.stop_primary_traffic,
            self.scale_secondary_region,
            self.update_dns_records,
            self.verify_secondary_health,
            self.notify_stakeholders
        ]
        
        for step in steps:
            try:
                step()
                self.log_step_success(step.__name__)
            except Exception as e:
                self.log_step_failure(step.__name__, e)
                self.escalate_to_manual_intervention()
```

### Manual Recovery Procedures

#### Database Recovery
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/recover_database.sh

# 1. Stop application services
kubectl scale deployment gaudi3-app --replicas=0

# 2. Create new RDS instance from backup
aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \
  --db-instance-identifier gaudi3-db-recovery \
  --db-snapshot-identifier gaudi3-db-snapshot-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 3. Wait for instance to be available
aws rds wait db-instance-available \
  --db-instance-identifier gaudi3-db-recovery

# 4. Update connection strings
kubectl patch configmap gaudi3-config \
  --patch='{"data":{"DB_HOST":"gaudi3-db-recovery.cluster-xyz.rds.amazonaws.com"}}'

# 5. Restart application services
kubectl scale deployment gaudi3-app --replicas=3
```

#### Infrastructure Recreation
```terraform
# terraform/disaster_recovery/main.tf
module "disaster_recovery" {
  source = "../modules/gaudi_cluster"
  
  # Recovery-specific configuration
  region = var.recovery_region
  cluster_size = var.recovery_cluster_size
  instance_type = "dl2q.24xlarge"
  
  # Use backup data sources
  backup_bucket = "gaudi3-dr-backups"
  config_backup_key = "latest/cluster-config.tar.gz"
  
  # Accelerated recovery settings
  skip_gpu_tests = true
  fast_provisioning = true
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "disaster-recovery"
    Purpose = "emergency-restoration"
    CostCenter = "infrastructure-dr"
  }
}
```
