# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Gaudi 3 Scale Starter project. ADRs document important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences.

## ADR Template

Use the following template for new ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Short Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local]

## Decision
[State the architecture decision and provide detailed justification]

## Consequences
[Document the positive and negative outcomes of this decision]

## Alternatives Considered
[List other options that were evaluated]

## Related Decisions
[Reference other ADRs that relate to this decision]
```

## Decision Process

1. **Identify Decision**: Recognize that an architectural decision needs to be made
2. **Research Options**: Investigate available alternatives and their trade-offs
3. **Create ADR**: Document the decision using the template above
4. **Review**: Get feedback from stakeholders and technical team
5. **Decide**: Make the final decision and update ADR status to "Accepted"
6. **Implement**: Execute the decision and update documentation as needed
7. **Review**: Periodically review ADRs for continued relevance
